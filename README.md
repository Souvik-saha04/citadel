CITADEL – SMART SHOPPING WITH AI BARGAINING

Citadel is a full‑stack e‑commerce web application designed around one simple idea:
shopping for daily essentials should be smart, affordable, and human.

From fresh milk in the morning to fruits, vegetables, biscuits, and late‑night snacks,
Citadel brings all everyday necessities to a single platform — but with a twist that
sets it apart from every ordinary e‑commerce app.

In Citadel, users don’t just buy.
They bargain.

------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT MAKES CITADEL UNFORGETTABLE

Citadel introduces an AI‑powered bargaining assistant that allows users to negotiate
prices just like they would in a real marketplace.

Instead of fixed prices, users can:
• Bargain for better deals
• Negotiate based on quantity or loyalty
• Interact with an intelligent AI that understands pricing logic
• Feel the thrill of saving money, not just spending it

This makes Citadel feel alive — not like a static shopping website, but like a real,
dynamic market experience brought online.

------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT YOU CAN BUY

Citadel focuses on real, daily‑use products that people depend on every day:

• Fresh milk and dairy products
• Farm‑fresh fruits and vegetables
• Biscuits, snacks, and packaged food
• Household and daily‑need essentials

Every product is curated with freshness, affordability, and availability in mind.

FINAL WORD

Citadel is not just an e‑commerce project.
It is a statement.

It combines full‑stack engineering, AI thinking, and real‑world problem solving
into a single application that feels practical, intelligent, and memorable.

This is the kind of project that makes someone pause and say:

“Oh… this wasn’t just another app.
This was something different.”
